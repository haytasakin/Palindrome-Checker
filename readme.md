                  PALINDROME-CHECKERS

A simple application to determine if a given string is a palindrome.

It was simply an excercise in working through a problem that started in as a conceptual programming discussion and ended as a coded solution. it was a great little mini project to solve. As it is, it may not be a very useful application but one can see how either the algorithm or the technique could be applied to other situations.
